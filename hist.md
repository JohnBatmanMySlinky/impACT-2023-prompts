Mr. ABC is a 60-year-old gentleman who had a markedly abnormal stress test earlier today in my office with severe chest pain after 5 minutes of exercise on the standard Bruce with horizontal ST depressions and moderate apical ischemia on stress imaging only. He required 3 sublingual nitroglycerin in total (please see also admission history and physical for full details).

Patient complains of constipation, severe at times. Has not had BM for two days. Has been ambulating well. No history suggestive of angina. Will be seeing cardiologist this afternoon.
